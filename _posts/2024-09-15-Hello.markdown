Hi, I'm Troy and this is my webpage. I hope you like it. I spend alot of time maintaining it and building it. It is hosted on github pages so I thought using the Jekyll website maker would be a good fit. Special thanks to freedns.afraid.org for my dns provider, making the website adress what it is instead of "troy-davies.github.io" which still works but just redirects you to "troyport.moo.com"

I hope you have a good day.

Troy.
